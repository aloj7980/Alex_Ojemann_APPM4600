This repository contains my homework and labs for the class APPM4600 at CU Boulder. 
The Homework folder contains the python code I used in each homework assignment. 
The deliverables for the homework assignments are documents with answers to the questions, which are not included here. 
The Labs folder contains all the labs for the course. The deliverables for the labs are typically the raw code which is included here. 
There are also midterm exams in this course, which will not be included here to avoid honor code violations.
